As more tools are developed for this testing strategy, they will be
added here. Soon there will be backends for Node.js testing with
[Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), Scala with
[ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org), and a frontend for Android
testing with
[Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html).

### Selenium

programatically manipulate web pages.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org). It allows tests to be written in a
[fluent style](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html)
