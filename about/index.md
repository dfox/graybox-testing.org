At my old company, [Cantina](http://cantina.co), I created a software
development process that relied heavily on the style of testing that
is described on this site. After years of working on different
projects for different clients, I found that it had the highest
benefit to cost ratio of all types of testing I tried. It also had the
highest benefit over time. After I left Cantina, I decided to put this
site up as a resource for others to see if they would get the same
benefit that I did.
